When editing a Wikipedia article, you can create a bulleted list byy putting each item on its own line and placing a star in front.
But say you have a really large list that you want to add bulklet points to. You could just type those stars at the beginning of eachline, one by one.
Or you could automate this task with a short Python script.
The bulletPointAdder.py script will get the text from the clipboard, add a star and space to the beginning of each line , and then paste this new text to the clipboard. 

Ex:

Lists of animals
Lists of Aquarium life
Lists of biologists by author bbreviation
lists of cultivars

==>


* Lists of animals
* Lists of Aquarium life
* Lists of biologists by author bbreviation
* Lists of cultivars
